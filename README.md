A concept of loyality application for Coca-Cola clients written in Flutter. Main idea of app is to encourage clients of Coca-Cola to buy more products.

This project was made for one of my courses at University. I know UX is not very intuitive but it's the best I could do in that time frame.

### Bubbles challenge
*Note: I had no idea how to explain it in UI*  
The concept is that there is global pool of bubbles. Users can shake their phones to add bubbles. If user adds last (10th) bubble, he or she earns extra points. There is 5 second interval between new shakes available.
